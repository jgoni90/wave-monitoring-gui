# Wave Monitoring GUI
This repository hosts the Real-Time Wave Monitoring GUI I developed for my MSc Thesis:

## Description of the file system
The software has been developed in a MATLABÂ© environment, structured as a combination
of a main UI file which uses data and callbacks located in the program folder. The
structure of the file system is distributed as follows:

![Main Folder Structure](https://github.com/jgoni90/wave-monitoring-gui/blob/master/mainfolderstructure.png)

The main file (WMGUI2.m) has the function of creating the main GUI layout, the variable structure
to be used by the functions, and assigning the specific callbacks for each UI element
and function.
